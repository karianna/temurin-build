# temurin-build FAQ

This document covers cover how to perform various repeatable tasks in the
repository that might not otherwise be obvious from just looking at the
repository.

## How do I find my way around Temurin's build automation scripts?

I wrote this diagram partially for my own benefit in [issue 957](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/issues/957) that lists the shell scripts (`S`) and environment scripts (`E`). I think it would be useful to incorporate this into the documentation (potentially annotated with a bit more info) so people can find their way around the myriad of script levels that we now have.
Note that the "end-user" scripts start at `makejdk-any-platform.sh` and a
diagram of those relationships can be seen [here](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/docs/images/AdoptOpenJDK_Build_Script_Relationships.png)

*See the [ci-jenkins-pipelines FAQ.md](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-do-i-find-my-way-around-adoptopenjdks-build-automation-scripts) for the Jenkins side of the pipeline*

```

There is also some documentation in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## What are the prerequisites for a system used for builds?

- The upstream OpenJDK build requirements are at [Supported Build Platforms](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Build/Supported+Build+Platforms)
- The Temurin levels we build on are in [Minimum-OS-levels](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/wiki/%5BWIP%5D-Minimum-OS-levels) although anything with comparable equivalent or later C libraries should work ok (in particular we have built on most current Linux distros without issues)

In terms of compilers, these are what we currently use for each release:

| Version | OS      | Compiler |
|---------|---------|----------|
| JDK8    | Linux   | GCC 4.8 (HotSpot) GCC 7.6 (OpenJ9)                |
| JDK11+  | Linux   | GCC 7.5                                           |
| JDK8    | Windows | VS2013 (12.0) (HotSpot) or VS2010 (10.0) (OpenJ9) |
| JDK11+  | Windows | VS2017                                            |
| JDK8/11 | AIX     | xlC/C++ 13.1.3                                    |
| JDK13+  | AIX     | xlC/C++ 16.1.0                                    |
| JDK8    | macos   | GCC 4.2.1 (LLVM 2336.11.00                        |
| JDK11   | macos   | clang-700.1.81                                    |
| JDK13+  | macos   | clang-900.0.39.2                                  |

All machines at Temurin are set up using the ansible playbooks from the
[infrastructure](https://github.com/adoptopenjdk/openjdk-infrastructure) repository.

## How do I change the parameters, such as configure flags, for a Jenkins build

Where you change them depends on the scope of the parameter or flag:

- *If the parameter will affect all users, regardless of environment or OS/Arch*
  - [build.sh](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/sbin/build.sh) OR [makejdk-any-platform.sh](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/makejdk-any-platform.sh) depending on how high up in the execution stack it needs to be.
  - [Example PR - Adding a new archival feature for OpenJ9 memory dumps](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/pull/2464)
- *If the parameter will affect all machines of a specific OS OR related to the environment set up by [our ansible scripts](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure) at the shell script level*
  - Modify the relevant environment files in [platform-specific-configurations](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/tree/master/build-farm/platform-specific-configurations)
  - [Example PR - Adding a new configure flag for OpenJ9 on all AIX machines](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/pull/1442/files)
- *If the parameter will affect only our jenkins environment or jenkins machine environment*
  - Modify the [pipeline files](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/tree/master/pipelines/build), although this is normally only done for configuration differences such as OpenJ9 Large Heap builds. See [the configuration file documentation](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines#configuration-files) for more information about adding or altering custom jenkins param.

### TL;DR (Quick Reference Table)

| Parameter Location | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| [build.sh](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/sbin/build.sh) OR [makejdk-any-platform.sh](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/makejdk-any-platform.sh) | Anyone (including end users) who are running [makejdk-any-platform.sh](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/makejdk-any-platform.sh) |
| [platform-specific-configurations](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/tree/master/build-farm/platform-specific-configurations) scripts | Those using [build-farm/make-adopt-build-farm.sh](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/build-farm/make-adopt-build-farm.sh) (inc. our pipelines) - should be stuff specific to our machines |
| Jenkins resources in [ci-jenkins-pipelines](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines) | Only when run through our jenkins pipelines. See the [configuration file documentation](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines#configuration-files) for more information |

## How to do a new release build

Since it's quite long, this is covered in a separate [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) document

## I've modified the build scripts - how can I test my changes?

If you're making changes ensure you follow the contribution guidelines in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) including running [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) if you're modifying the shell scripts.

For more information, see the [PR testing documentation](Testing.md).

## Which OS levels do we build on?

The operating systems/distributions which we build or are documented in the
[temurin-build wiki](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/wiki/%5BWIP%5D-Minimum-OS-levels).
Runtime platforms are in our [supported platforms page](https://adoptium.net/supported_platforms.html).

## How to add a new build pipeline param and associated job configuration?

[This PR](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/pull/2416) demonstrates changes required to add a new build pipeline param and the associated version/platform job configurations for setting the value when needed  (note, the `pipelines/` dir has since been moved to our [jenkins repository](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines)).
